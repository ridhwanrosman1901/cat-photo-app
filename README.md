# CatPhotoApp

CatPhotoApp is a fun and simple webpage designed to showcase adorable cat photos, share interesting facts about cats, and provide a form for cat lovers to submit their own cat photos. This project is created for educational purposes and aims to demonstrate basic HTML structure, elements, and forms.

## Features

- **Cat Photos**: A gallery section with a link to view more cat photos.
- **Cat Lists**: Information on things cats love and hate, displayed in ordered and unordered lists.
- **Cat Form**: A form that allows users to submit information about their cat's type and personality, along with a photo URL.

## HTML Structure

The HTML document is structured with the following key sections:

1. **Header (`<h1>`)**: The main title of the webpage.
2. **Main Content (`<main>`)**: Contains three main sections:
   - **Cat Photos Section**: Displays an image and link to more cat photos.
   - **Cat Lists Section**: Contains two lists â€” one unordered list for things cats love and one ordered list for things cats hate.
   - **Cat Form Section**: A form for users to submit information about their cat.
3. **Footer (`<footer>`)**: Provides a disclaimer and a link to freeCodeCamp.
